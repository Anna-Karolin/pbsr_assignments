Question 2
Computed the MLE of parameters of gamma distribution using 'optim' function for a random sample generated by 'rgamma' function
Repeated this step 1000 times and plotted the histogram for different values of MLE across samples
Repeated the above two steps for different sample sizes- 20,40 and 100
Then we see that the difference between 2.5 percentile and 97.5 percentile points is inversely related to the sample size

Question 3
Using 'optim', computed the MLE estimates of parameters for different bimodal distributions fitted on the data of waiting times from 'Faithful' data set
Plotted these maximum likelihood bimodal distributions and computed the AIC values
We see that log normal-log normal is the best fit among the given bimodal distributions

Question 4
For the data of Insurance Holders and Claims made, fitted OLS regression with Gaussian errors and with Laplace errors, log normal regression and Gamma regression using 'optim' function
Computed the BIC value for each fitted model and thus concluded that Gamma regression is the best fit among all candidates

Question 5
A random sample for the closed adjusted values of TCS and Nifty50 was taken, Method of Moments used to estimate the parameters.
Then using the lm() built-in function, the parameters were estimated.
Finally the expected TCS price given the data is calculated using parameters evaluated using both the methods, and the two methods compared.
